        <h2 style="border: solid 3px #3333ff">African Lion Conservation Status South Africa and Southern Africa:</h2>
        <P > There is probably no other species whose distributional range has shrunk over historical times to the<br>
            extent shown by the lion. At one time the distribution of the African Lion was throughout much of Europe, <br>
            Asia and Africa. They are now extinct in Europe, and only about 190 individuals remain in north western <br>
            India where their conservation status is seriously threatend. There are no longer in lions north of the Sahara,<br>
            and their range in the Southern African subregion has also shrunk considerably. Lions are great wanderers, and<br>
            so sometimes turn up in areas where they have been unknown for many years.<br>
            <br>
            Today most interactions between humans and lions are limited to encounters in game reserves. Lions have been<br>
            recorded stalking game from behind the cover of cars and buses and will settle down to rest in the shade provided<br>
            by the vehicle. 'Park' lions offer visitors the opportunity to watch them for hours doing what they do best - lying<br>
            around doing nothing and looking majestic. Most game reserves require that vehicles stick to the roads or tracks<br>
            so should the lions wish to avoid people they can easily do so. In safari - hunting areas lions are wary of humans<br>
            and will avoid contact wherever possible.<br>

        <p>
            In remote areas stock-killing lions used to be fairly common,<br>
            and were dealt with in a variety of ways. This has however confined<br>
            the African Lions distribution to remote, uninhabited or protected<br>
            areas and there is little incidence involving livestock killing.<br>
